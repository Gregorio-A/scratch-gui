# TextWarp IDE

The TextWarp IDE extends the existing Scratch/TurboWarp shell. It does not create a separate runtime: code,
blocks, stage, targets and project assets still operate on the same VM.

## Code editor

Monaco provides syntax highlighting, indentation, bracket completion, minimap, multiple target models and
independent primary/secondary editors. Font size is persistent and can be changed in Preferences, from the
slider below the editor, or with `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-` and `Ctrl+0`.

## Language intelligence

The language service provides completion, hover, signatures, document symbols, definitions, references, safe
rename, formatting and contextual project resources. Diagnostics always retain their stable error code.

## Software-specific resources

Actors, stage, variables, lists, broadcasts, costumes, sounds and loaded extensions appear as project resources.
References use stable IDs so renaming a resource can update textual modules safely.

## Project organization

Every target is an editable `.tw` module. The explorer distinguishes editable source from generated artifacts.
Open-file tabs, project-wide search and replacement, recent targets and local history support larger projects.

## Main software integration

Compilation writes directly to `scratch-vm`; the native Blocks view reads the same target. The browser uses web
file APIs and downloads. Electron injects native file handles through the shared platform boundary.

## Execution and console

Run, Stop, Restart and selection execution operate on the current VM. The Console tab records input, output,
runtime errors and target context.

## Debugging

The Debugger tab exposes threads, execution state, source location, call stacks, variables, target state and safe
watch expressions. Breakpoints can pause concurrent scripts independently.

## Productivity and recovery

Autosave snapshots remain local to the device. Templates, formatting, project-wide replacement and `.textwarp`
packages help recover and transfer editable work.

## Integrated documentation

Documentation is selected from the active Scratch GUI language. Portuguese uses the canonical Portuguese
manuals; all other locales fall back to the complete English manuals.

## Security and stability

Documentation HTML is sanitized. External links use `noopener,noreferrer`. Package import has strict archive and
path limits. External source files are read or written only after an explicit user picker action.

## Usability and accessibility

The toolbar wraps into accessible groups on small screens. The stage moves below the editor on phone-sized
windows. Side, split and bottom panels are resizable; the project sidebar becomes an overlay when space is
limited. All important commands remain keyboard reachable.
